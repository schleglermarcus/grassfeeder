--------------- Create debian packages
<marcus_der_schlegler> Hello, I am new here
<marcus_der_schlegler> I try to run the debcargo-conf  to publish my desktop application. But I am stuck with the requirement of it being "published on crates.i"
<marcus_der_schlegler> My application is a rust+gtk3  desktop application, that relies on several components and path dependencies.  Those shall not be published by 'cargo publish'.
<marcus_der_schlegler> I can create working debian packages already with cargo-deb.  Any next ideas how to proceed?
<noctis> hi, debcargo has basically no support for "off grid" crates. you likely need to follow the old manual path

<capitol> check how many of them that we already have packaged with debcargo
<capitol> https://crates.io/crates/debcargo
<capitol> sorry, cargo-debstatus i meant: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-debstatus
<capitol> it's getting late here

<count_omega> that is being worked on by bastif and myself
<count_omega> may I ask which program you're trying to package ?
<count_omega> cargo-debstatus shows you conveniently which packes/crates are
missing. just run it against the cloned repo of the program.
<count_omega> https://paste.debian.net/1272973/
<marcus_der_schlegler> i see it.  2nd chapter are local repos, directly available.
<marcus_der_schlegler> for the other chapters, I am not sure what you mean with
   "from scratch". I guess they are not in the debian repo yet
<count_omega> didn't check 100% but I deleted all gtk-related stuff and packages
skipped by cargo-debstatus where a newer version is in debian. I'd suggest to
begin with with qname* , unic* and i18n stuff since that is the biggest chunk imho
<count_omega> yeah, they need packaging from scratch

<count_omega> yeah, they need packaging from scratch
<count_omega> It's a lot of packages, granted, even sans the gtk stuff. But
packaging a crate is straightforward and faster than a regular debian package
imho. if you want to dive in. I'd suggest thsi red
<count_omega> https://blog.hackeriet.no/packaging-a-rust-project-for-debian/
<count_omega> I'm sure most of the packages missing will be packaged by the
rust team, but likely not all of them
<count_omega> well the qname* stuff for instance would be an easy start
for packaging a rust crate

<count_omega> I meant since a big chuck of the crates your program uses are not in debian an official debian package will less likely happen cargo-deb is a good way to distribute it in the meantime. it's not an issur if you don't want to maintain all those crates
<count_omega> *issue
<count_omega> You could file a RPF (request for packaging bug ) againt the wnpp package
<count_omega> *against




<pabs> the rust team workflow relies on crates.io
<pabs> Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk> is the main person packaging
Rust stuff outside the Rust team, so maybe ask him about his workflow
<marcus_> Thanks @pabs. You mean I shall write him an e-mail directly? Is he expecting that? Or is there some other manual page that I could read ?
<pabs> yeah, send an email. should be fine. don't think he documented his setup yet
<pabs> tell him I sent you if you want
