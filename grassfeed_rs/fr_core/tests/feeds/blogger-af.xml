    <title type="text">State Street Global Advisors Should be Classified as a Hate Group</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Leaders at one of the largest investment firms in the world, State Street Global Advisors, will need to ask permission to hire White men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1517879/state-street-white-privilege-news-blm-woke-diversity-positive-action"&gt;The bank's feminist head of inclusion and diversity, Jess McNicholas&lt;/a&gt; said she wants more female representation in senior positions. The sexist stated "&lt;i&gt;All of our leaders have to demonstrate at their annual appraisals what they have done to improve female representation and the number of colleagues from ethnic-minority backgrounds.&lt;/i&gt;" If women cannot be hired for any particular position, the sexist administrator said that minority men should be hired. The firm will still hire White men, McNicholas said, but recruiters are required to show that women and minority applicants were interviewed by the panels.&amp;nbsp; If executives face lowered bonuses if they dont met "diversity" goals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same company that commissioned the feminazi statue 'Fearless Girl' which stands in front of the New York Stock exchange. It is supposed to represent female superiority. A plaque originally placed below the statue stated: "Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference,"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any person not hired by this company due to their skin color or gender can file a discrimination lawsuit. State Street Global Advisors Should be Classified as a 'hate group'. It doesn't belong in the 21st century. Ms McNicholas should be fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">MeToo Women Found Guilty of Defamation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2021/05/15/all-swedish-women-accused-of-defamation-connected-to-metoo-found-guilty/"&gt;The Swedish television program&lt;/a&gt; 'Crime of the' Week reviewed ten defamation cases linked to MeToo allegations over the last several years and found that in every single case, judges had sided against the women making public allegations of sexual abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“All women have the right to their story, and you can tell what you want to a close circle of family and friends, but you can’t single people out in public,&lt;/i&gt;” lawyer Angel Eklund told SVT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broadcaster noted that eight women were convicted of gross slander, while the other two were convicted of libel. Six of the cases have seen a final judgement, while three others await appeals, and the final case has been referred for an appeal to the Swedish supreme court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In march of this year,&amp;nbsp; a Swedish feminist group began soliciting donations to cover fines that were imposed by courts after a successful defamation prosecution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this shows is that the feminist #Metoo movement had given a license for women to falsely accuse men of anything. They thought there would be no repercussions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.europenowjournal.org/2020/03/09/saying-metoo-in-the-swedish-legal-system-the-importance-of-believing-women/" rel="nofollow"&gt; As shown in an article written by feminist Caitlin Carroll, &lt;/a&gt;the entire premise of the movement is that women should be believed because of their gender while men should always be presumed guilty. The actual actions of individuals are irrelevant to the small feminist mind.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, Carroll's entire article promotes the obsolete feminist notion that women dont commit sexual violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feminist #MeToo movement is based on gender hate rather than judging people on the basis of their actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Did New York Governor  Cuomo Just Legalize Pink Privilege?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-reminds-new-yorkers-pink-tax-ban-goes-effect-today" rel="nofollow"&gt;Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced that starting October 1&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; businesses are prohibited from charging a so called&amp;nbsp; "pink tax," otherwise known as the practice of charging different prices for for men and women.&amp;nbsp; For example, women's hair cuts and razor blades must now cost the same as men's hair cuts and blades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The new measure requires certain service providers to provide price lists for standard services upon request and notifies them that gender-based price discrimination is prohibited under State law.&amp;nbsp; Governor Cuomo said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;"New York is leading the nation in advancing women's rights and this milestone marks the latest step in New York's journey to break down barriers and put women on an equal playing field,"&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;"By abolishing the pink tax, women and girls will no longer be subject to harmful and unfair price discrimination and any businesses who fail to put an end to this despicable practice will be held accountable."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul stated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;"Women and girls continue to face inequalities in many aspects of their daily lives, and it is unacceptable that they have to pay more than men for similar goods and services. Eliminating the pink tax helps put an end to gender-based pricing, ensure financial success and break down barriers for women. We do not tolerate discriminatory actions in our state, and we will continue to fight to eliminate the gender wage gap and achieve full equality and justice for all New Yorkers."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, there are already businesses that are violating the so-called 'gender-based pricing law'.&amp;nbsp; Mable's Smokehouse is advertising "Ladies Night" for October 7th. &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ladies-night-tickets-94061176511"&gt;They list prices for ladies ONLY.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many bars, restaurants and auto shops advertise discounts days for women.&amp;nbsp; Any New York business doing this after October 1st could potentially be sued for sex discrimination using&amp;nbsp; this law. Additionally, if New York blocks the law suit or tries to legally&amp;nbsp; justify discrimination against men then the state is open for a class action sex discrimination lawsuit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear if Cuomo was trying to eliminate gender double standards or extended pink privilege in New York. If he is really interested in ending discrimination then a similar law should be created for the state's judicial system.&amp;nbsp; Judges should be prohibited from issuing different sentencing terms for men and women who commit the same crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Utah Twitter Account Lists Names of Men Accused of Rape</title>
    <content type="html">Women are posting the names of men they claim are rapists on Twitter. They are using the&amp;nbsp; using the account #UtahRapists. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/07/03/sexual-assault-survivors/"&gt;hashtag&lt;/a&gt;, collects tweets&amp;nbsp; and makes them searchable by name so that anyone can look up men. It appears similar to an an old website called Dont Date Him Girl It.com. That site publicly listed the names of cheating men until it was discovered that many of the women posting names were themselves cheats &amp;amp; frauds. The Dont Date Him Girl stopped publicly listing men's names after numerous threatened lawsuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Twitter account #UtahRapists has no real way of proving the accuracy of the rape accusations against eh men in its list. Women could be falsely accusing someone of&amp;nbsp; rape without any evidence. Additionally, someone may have committed assault or harassment, but not rape, and still be labeled a rapist by the twitter account. There have already been a few men who claimed they were falsely accused of rape by the account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul C. Burke, a Utah attorney who has been hired by some of the men claiming they are victims of false accusations by #UtahRapists stated: "No person should be branded with a scarlet letter ‘R’ by an anonymous Twitter mob". “There must be accountability for actual rapists, but it should come through our criminal justice system that begins with a presumption of innocence for the accused and operates under the principle of due process for all.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #UtahRapists Twitter accounts has admitted&amp;nbsp; taking some names off their lists, saying that they’ve since found evidence that the accused didn’t rape anyone.&amp;nbsp; But thats not good enough. The false rape accuser should be named so that other men can avoid her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new account should be created #UtahFalseRapeAccusers.&amp;nbsp; Legal action should also be taken against false rape accusers.</content>

    <title type="text">New York Times Article Displays Feminazi Ideology</title>
    <content type="html">The New York Times recently wrote an article titled 'Why Are Women-Led Nations Doing Better With COVID-19?'&amp;nbsp; The article emphasized&amp;nbsp; the feminist idea of female superiority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200518004013/https://news.yahoo.com/why-women-led-nations-doing-141151130.html" style="outline-width: 0px !important; user-select: auto !important;"&gt;The Times states:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Monday was a day of triumph for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Thanks to the efforts of the entire nation, she said, New Zealand had been largely successful in meeting its ambitious goal of eradicating, rather than just controlling, outbreaks of COVID-19. The lockdown she had put in place March 25 could now end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ardern’s success is the latest data point in a widely noticed trend: Countries led by women seem to be particularly successful in fighting the coronavirus.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Germany, led by Angela Merkel, has had a far lower death rate than Britain, France, Italy or Spain. Finland, where Prime minister Sanna Marin, 34, governs with a coalition of four female-led parties, has had fewer than 10% as many deaths as nearby Sweden. And Tsai Ing-wen, president of Taiwan, has presided over one of the most successful efforts in the world at containing the virus, using testing, contact tracing and isolation measures to control infections without a full national lockdown.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The presence of a female leader may be a signal that a country has more inclusive political institutions and values.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Having a female leader is one signal that people of diverse backgrounds — and thus, hopefully, diverse perspectives on how to combat crises — are able to win seats at that table.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;By contrast,&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;the male-led governments of Sweden and Britain — both of which have high coronavirus death tolls — appear to have relied primarily on epidemiological modeling by their own advisers, with few channels for dissent from outside experts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"What we learned with COVID is that, actually, a different kind of leader can be very beneficial,”&amp;nbsp; Alice Evans said. &lt;/i&gt;[ a sociologist at King's College London]&lt;i&gt; “Perhaps people will learn to recognize and value risk-averse, caring and thoughtful leaders.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As of May 28, "female led" New Zealand has&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/new-zealand/"&gt;22 virus related deaths&lt;/a&gt; with a population of 4.88 million (or 4.5 deaths per million people). Yet nearby male led Australia&amp;nbsp; has 103 deaths&amp;nbsp;with a population of 25.99 million (4 deaths per million people) How is female led New Zealand doing significantly better?? They are actually worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, Germany has recorded 8533 virus related deaths with a population of 83 million (102.8 deaths per million). Yet, the nearby male led Czech Republic has recorded 317 deaths with a population of 10.65 million (29.8 deaths per million people). Neighbor Poland (male led) recorded 1030 deaths with a population of 37.97 million (27.1 deaths per million people). How does Merkel's response prove female supremacy? She has a higher mortality rate than her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New York Times compared "male led" Sweden with Finland. Sweden is hardly a male led nation. In 2016, Swedish feminist lawmakers passed legislation requiring sidewalks&amp;nbsp; and bus lanes be cleared before roadways after it snows. This is because a study found women are more likely to travel by foot or public transportation.&amp;nbsp; The result has been a disaster. Ambulances and fire trucks have difficulty getting to emergencies because public workers are shoveling sidewalks for women. Sweden is more concerned about removing snow according to the feminist principle of female privilege than it is about getting emergency vehicles quickly to their destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more appropriate comparison for Finland&amp;nbsp; would be with nearby male led Baltic nations of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.&amp;nbsp; As discussed above, Poland's virus mortality rate is&amp;nbsp; 27.1 deaths per million people.&amp;nbsp; Lithuania recorded 68 virus deaths with a population of 2.79 million (24.4 deaths per million people) while Latvia recorded 24 deaths for a population&amp;nbsp; 1.92 million&amp;nbsp; (12.5 deaths per million people.&amp;nbsp; Female led Finland is worse than all 3 countries.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Finland has recorded 313 virus related deaths with a population of 5.51 million people (56.8 deaths per million people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;There is nothing special about any of the three female led nations. They are doing better than some countries but worse than others. Only woman led Taiwan is doing much better than others. They claim 7 deaths for a population of 23.7 million people. One woman doing well hardly makes a case for female supremacy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The New York Times article was not meant to convey facts or accuracy. It was meant to promote the feminist idea of female superiority. The article is an example of the feminazi culture that exists within this news organization.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Joe Biden Threatens Male College Students</title>
    <content type="html">Presidential candidate Joe Biden has threatened to roll back the rights of male college students. He stated he will undo Betsy DeVos's Title IX reforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devos's had cancelled the Department of Education's 2011 guidelines for sexual assault.&amp;nbsp; The old guidelines instructed colleges to use a&amp;nbsp; minimal standard of proof, called “preponderance of the evidence,” (meaning a 50.1% possibility)&amp;nbsp; when judging whether a male student was guilty of sexual assault. The standard allowed colleges to kick men out of school based only on an accusation. Devos also recently removed the vague definition of sexual harassment&amp;nbsp; from&amp;nbsp; an "unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature." and redefined it to mean a pervasive offense that prevents a student's equal access to the "school's education program or activity". Lastly, her reforms gave an accused student the right to cross examine his accuser via a representative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biden wants the Title IX reforms eliminated, the 2011 guidelines restored and labels accusing female students as "survivors". &lt;a href="https://archive.is/DUQQe"&gt;He stated:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Survivors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced,” “Today, Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump published a rule that flies in the face of that belief and guarantees that college campuses will be less safe for our nation's young people.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Working with survivors and advocates, we helped to bring this violence out of the shadows and required schools change their practices,”&amp;nbsp; “Now, Trump's Education Department — led by Betsy DeVos — is trying to shame and silence survivors, and take away parents' peace of mind.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&amp;nbsp;[Devos's&amp;nbsp; reforms]&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;“gives colleges a green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their rights.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“It's wrong,” “And, it will be put to a quick end in January 2021, because as President, I'll be right where I always have been throughout my career — on the side of survivors, who deserve to have their voices heard, their claims taken seriously and investigated, and their rights upheld.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These are ironic statements from Biden because he is currently&amp;nbsp; being accused of sexual assault by Tara Reade. If he wants a minimal standard of evidence used for judging a male student's guilt then his guilt should also be judged using the same low standard. If he does not want accusing female students cross examined then Ms. Reade should not be cross examined either. Lastly, Ms. Reade should be designated a "survivor" therefore Biden should be kicked out of the Presidential race regardless of actual evidence of guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guidelines should be used for every politician who advocates taking away the rights of male college students. If one of these legislators is accused of wrong doing then the 'preponderance of the evidence' standard should be used for judging their guilt.&amp;nbsp; They should not be allowed to cross examine their accuser. Lastly, the accused politician should be kicked out of office regardless of limited evidence of guilt. Let these politicians be treated the same way they advocate male college students be treated.&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Are Female Politicians Better Than Male Politicians?</title>
    <content type="html">Common feminist propaganda claims &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/08/do-women-in-congress-work-harder-than-their-male-colleagues/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"women &lt;/i&gt;[politicians] &lt;i&gt;focus more on their constituents than men do. Female members of Congress are more likely to emphasize constituent services,"  "They are"more likely to sit on committees that address issues that are important to their districts, to introduce and co-sponsor legislation that reflects their voters’ concerns&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/08/do-women-in-congress-work-harder-than-their-male-colleagues/" rel="nofollow"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/08/do-women-in-congress-work-harder-than-their-male-colleagues/" rel="nofollow" style="outline-width: 0px !important; user-select: auto !important;"&gt;"&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Here are a few examples challenging the feminist narrative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Denver, Councilwoman Candi CdeBaca endorsed a tweet that recommended violence against political opponents. The tweet stated &lt;a href="https://denverite.com/2020/03/03/in-extremely-2020-news-councilwoman-cdebaca-retweets-tweet-about-coronavirus-spreading-at-maga-rallies/"&gt;"For the record, if I do get the coronavirus, I'm attending every MAGA rally I can."&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Imagine if a male politician endorsed violence against opponents. Imagine if they endorsed the idea of spreading a virus among Trump supporters or Biden supporters or Sanders supporters. Outlets such as the Washington Post would use the incident as another example of intolerance among men. Does it really seem like CdeBaca is&amp;nbsp; emphasizing voter issues? Is she addressing voter issues or spreading intolerance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another example, Champaign, Illinois Mayor Deborah Feinen signed an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/wandtv.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/51/551ced24-6535-11ea-9826-4f4fd396dacb/5e6b960454b21.pdf.pdf"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; related to the COVID-19 Virus. The City of Champaign announced the executive order, saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://champaignil.gov/2020/03/12/mayor-feinen-declares-local-emergency-related-to-the-covid-19-virus/"&gt;Mayor Deborah Frank Feinen issued an Executive Order declaring the existence of a local emergency in the City of Champaign related to the COVID-19 virus, which is causing or is anticipated to cause widespread impacts on the health of members of the community.  Provisions in Chapter 12 of the Champaign Municipal Code provide the Mayor authorization to declare an emergency for a limited period of time.  This allows the Mayor to exercise significant emergency powers at the inception of the emergency, and then to provide an opportunity for the City Council, as a whole, to deal with an emergency.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The city council gave the mayor power to impose curfew, seize private property, close all liquor stores and ban gun / ammunition&amp;nbsp; sales.&amp;nbsp; There are currently no known virus cases in the city. After several groups protested.&amp;nbsp; Champaign city attorney Fred Stavins, stated &lt;i&gt;“Again, there’s nothing that compels the exercise of any of these powers, and they’re extensive, there’s no doubt about it — you look at these and you say, ‘Holy cow! The mayor can confiscate property!' Hopefully, that’s never going to be required,”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Seizing property or preventing gun and liquor sales has nothing to do with preventing the spread of the virus. Feinen was using virus fear to act like Joseph Stalin. She was interested only in increasing her own political power and rule . Does it really seem like Feinen is focusing on her constituents or is she focusing on herself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Orleans Mayor, LaToya Cantrell, did the same thing.&amp;nbsp; She issued an &lt;a href="http://www.nola.gov/mayor/executive-orders/emergency-declarations/20200311-mayoral-proclamation-of-a-state-of-emergency-due-to-covid-19/"&gt;emergency order&lt;/a&gt; giving her the authority to seize property and stop gun or liquor sales&amp;nbsp; in the name of containing the coronavirus.&amp;nbsp;Her declaration has nothing to do with containing&amp;nbsp; the virus . It has everything to do with totalitarianism and political power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Female politicians are no different than male politicians. Some are good and some are bad. Is the US ever going to reach a point where politicians are judged on the basis of policy rather than feminist propaganda and obsolete gender stereotypes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Sexist Hypocrite Taylor Swift</title>
    <content type="html">Singer Taylor Swift released a new music video for her song&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/watch-taylor-swift-is-a-whining-feminist-man-basher-in-latest-music-video-the-man"&gt;'The Man'&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in which she imagines she is a narcissistic playboy businessman who is free from any consequences whatsoever. She claims men are not held accountable for their actions and they can do whatever they want. Her song is meant to promote feminist propaganda and hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the lyrics are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;I would be cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They’d say I played the field before&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;I found someone to commit to &lt;br /&gt;And that would be okay for me to do&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Every conquest I had made"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Her words shows she believes men's sexuality should be controlled. According to her feminist mindset, only women have dating choices and options. Once a man is selected, he must commit to the women who chose him. He has no choice. If men claim the same dating options for themselves, Swift categorizes it as '&lt;i&gt;conquest&lt;/i&gt;'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"When everyone believes ya&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What’s that like?".&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A hypocrite feminist statement. When have men ever been believed simply because they are male? Certainly not on college campuses. Many male students have been falsely accused of rape and kicked out of college simply because of the word of a women.&amp;nbsp; This is also true in feminist controlled family courts. A women is much more likely to be believed than a man.&amp;nbsp; The most popular feminist saying&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; "believe all women" .&amp;nbsp; It should be men asking "When everyone believes ya What’s that like?".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"What’s it like to brag about raking in dollars" &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;She does this so why is she wondering what its like to brag?? Its more of her gender double standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swift's&amp;nbsp; song, in essence, is a demand for more female privilege and double standard. She does not want to be held responsible for her actions. She does not want to be held accountable for her behavior. She sings about so called male privilege yet paternity fraud remains legal throughout most of the US. Thats not male privilege. ITS FEMALE PRIVILEGE. Where's the accountability?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor Swift has become a messenger of sexism and hate. She sees herself as a god and men as inferior to her. She is a complete feminist.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; </content>

    <title type="text">False Rape Accuser Kellie Bartlett Avoids Jail</title>
    <content type="html">Kellie Bartlett&amp;nbsp; had been cheating on her husband Shane Bartlett&amp;nbsp; for over a year with a Michigan deputy, She worked as a clerk in the Eaton County Sheriff's Office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spring of 2017, the Deputy ended the relationship and asked Mrs. Bartlett to stop contacting him.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2020/01/30/sentencing-delayed-charlotte-woman-who-accused-deputy-rape/4607259002/"&gt;According to, Michigan State Police Detective Sgt. Erik Darling,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;after the relationship ended, Kellie Bartlett continued trying to contact the deputy and began stalking him.&amp;nbsp; In December 2017, she was&amp;nbsp; fired for undisclosed reasons thought possibly relating to the stalking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January 2018, Mrs Bartlett&amp;nbsp; filed a compliant with Michigan State Police&amp;nbsp; claiming the Michigan deputy had sexually assaulted her in March 2017. News reports also state her husband - who was the police chief for the town of Potterville - may have helped her file the false compliant.&amp;nbsp; What she told her husband remains unclear. As a result of Mrs Bartlett's compliant, a criminal investigation was initiated against the deputy. However, the investigation determined backstabbing wife,&amp;nbsp; Kellie Bartlett, was a "willing and consenting partner" in the sexual encounters. She then admitted to the affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Bartlett initially faced 16 charges related to her job at the Eaton County Sheriff's Office and her false report to Michigan State Police that the deputy raped her.&amp;nbsp; Most of the charges were dismissed in exchange for Mrs Bartlett's guilty plea to 'false report of a felony', 'lying to a police officer', unauthorized access to a computer,&amp;nbsp; stalking and identity theft. The last charge&amp;nbsp; resulted from her faking a&amp;nbsp; physician's note in order to receive compensation for time off from her clerk job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Clinton Canady stated Kellie Bartlett can avoid jail if she stays out of trouble until her official sentencing hearing in December 2020.&amp;nbsp; She will be issued curfew rather than incarceration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, the American judicial system fails to hold a false rape accuser accountable for her actions. This is exactly why so many false rape accusations occur.&amp;nbsp; Women can even falsely accuse police officers of rape without fear of the law.&amp;nbsp; In this feminist era, are grown women ever going to be held responsible for their own criminal behavior?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">An Example of Why Men Don't Get Married</title>
    <content type="html">A father posted that his daughter Anna (25) cheated on her boyfriend Adam (27) and is now pregnant with the other man's child. The boyfriend and girlfriend were apparently living together. Anna told Adam about the pregnancy but not the fact the child was not his. The father said Adam called him and&amp;nbsp; wanted to propose to Anna. He asked for proposal tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The father then posted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Three days later he [Adam] comes to drop a wailing Anna off at our house with all of her belongings. Apparently, Anna's friend told him about the cheating. That is the only thing she told us through the crying. Adam didn't say anything he just took her stuff out of the car and drove off."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"This is the fourth day since it happened and Anna is posting on her Facebook things like "Men are trash" and badmouthing her friend who told Adam."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;[My wife] &lt;i&gt;started saying things like "you'll find someone better" , "he wasn't man enough anyway" which disturbed me".&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I was, and still am , deeply disgusted with my daughter."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The full details of his post can be read &lt;a href="https://snew.notabug.io/r/relationships/comments/f1cm91/i_58m_feel_like_i_never_really_knew_my_wife_57f/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna is exactly why so many men dont want to get married today. She was willing to stab a man who loved her in the back. She was willing to trick him into raising someone else's child.&amp;nbsp; Then, after this man dumped her, she posts Facebook statements such as 'Men are trash'. She thinks she is so wonderful that her cheating and fraud should not matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the couple had married and Adam later found out about the fraud, most family courts would support Anna not Adam. Paternity fraud is still legal in most states in the US as well as much of the western world. She is a reason why the marriage rate in America is at its &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/195951/marriage-rate-in-the-united-states-since-1990/"&gt;lowest point&lt;/a&gt; in this country's history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna's friend is obviously someone with integrity. That person saved Adam from a life of exploitation. Its unfortunate that somewhere on Facebook a self centered&amp;nbsp; woman named Anna is posting lies and disinformation about this person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Washington Post Suspends Feminist Reporter for Posting Personal Information of Her Critics After Kobe Bryant's Death</title>
    <content type="html">Feminist reporter Felicia Sonmez was suspended by the Washington Post after publishing private information about her critics..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just hours after 41-year-old Kobe Bryant was one of nine people — including his 13-year-old daughter Gianna —&amp;nbsp; killed in a Los Angeles helicopter crash Sunday, Sonmez&amp;nbsp; tweeted out a 2016 Daily Beast story about the 2003 rape allegation against the legendary Laker. This was how she wanted Bryant to be remembered - as an accussed rapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonmez was immediately criticized by thousands of Twitter users for her decision. Not only is the allegation 17 years old, but Bryant’s accuser chose money over testifying. For his part, Bryant apologized to the woman without admitting to any wrongdoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two hours after her tweet, she responded by stating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well, THAT was eye-opening,” “To the 10,000 people (literally) who have commented and emailed me with abuse and death threats, please take a moment to read the story …&amp;nbsp; Any public figure is worth remembering in their totality … even if that figure is beloved.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The feminist reporter then tweeted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Hard to see what’s accomplished by messages such as these,”&amp;nbsp; “If your response to a news article is to resort to harassment and intimidation of journalists, you might want to consider that your behavior says more about you them the person you’re targeting.&lt;/i&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Her tweet also included a screen shot of her email box. The screen shot included&amp;nbsp; personal information of people criticizing her.&amp;nbsp; She was subsequently suspended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feminist has since deleted all of her tweets. However, many reporters have no problem with her releasing personal information of critics and are now &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/washington-post-newsroom-revolts-after-reporter-felicia-sonmez-suspended-for-kobe-bryant-tweets" rel="nofollow"&gt;expressing their own outrage.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;They believe that criticism of the media should be stamped out. This is especially true if the journalist is a feminist who is trying to discredit the reputation of a popular man.</content>

    <title type="text">New York Times is a Bastion of Sexism</title>
    <content type="html">The New York Times editorial board recently endorsed both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) for the Democratic presidential nomination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The news organization begins by &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200120201717/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/19/opinion/amy-klobuchar-elizabeth-warren-nytimes-endorsement.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;undermining Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;. The Times stated&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;"There are plenty of progressives who are hungry for major change but may harbor lingering concerns about a messenger as divisive as Mr. Sanders".&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;They also claimed Sanders is too bossy stating &lt;i&gt;"Only his prescriptions can be the right ones, even though most are overly rigid,"&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Additionally the newspaper dismissed the Vermont Senator because "&lt;i&gt;Mr. Sanders would be 79 when he assumed office, and after an October heart attack, his health is a serious concern. "&lt;/i&gt; Yet that makes him 7 years younger than Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Times has never called for Ginsburg to resign from the Court due to her age or health. Instead, they continuously endorse her. Why does the NEw York Times claim its OK for an 86 year old woman to be on the Supreme Court but unacceptable for a 79 year old man to be president?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Times then stated "&lt;i&gt;Elizabeth Warren has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic left.&lt;/i&gt;"&amp;nbsp; The news site stated Warren had plans to reform the government, plans to reform housing, plans to regulate business&amp;nbsp; and plans to expand welfare. Yet they gave no details on any of Warren's alleged plans other than a welfare tax would be enacted in order to pay for the expansion of welfare. The Times also ignored the fact Warren continuously lied about her heritage. They simply stated "&lt;i&gt;Senator Warren is a gifted storyteller."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;In supporting Amy Klobuchar, the Times stated she, "&lt;i&gt;is the very definition of Midwestern charisma, grit and sticktoitiveness. Her lengthy tenure in the Senate and bipartisan credentials would make her a deal maker (a real one) and uniter for the wings of the party — and perhaps the nation.&lt;/i&gt;" They ignored the many accusations from former staffers that &lt;a href="https://archive.is/KrghA"&gt;she is an abusive manager&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Yet the news organization did not ignore similar criticisms of abuse against Sanders and President Trump. They have attacked both men as being 'too bossy'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New York Times disregarded male candidates for a variety of reasons: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is too green, former Vice President Joe Biden doesn’t promise enough change, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang is too inexperienced and billionaire Mike Bloomberg avoids difficult questions and refuses to allow several women with whom he has nondisclosure settlements to speak freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Times previously endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, before going on to endorse her in the general election as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers should not take New York Times articles at face value. The news organization does not write objectively nor do they disclose full information. Readers should understand the New York Times has a sexist culture and writes from a perspective of gender double standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Feminist Researcher Advocates Husbands Give Their Wives a Cheating Pass</title>
    <content type="html">A feminist social researcher claims the ultimate present a husband can give his wife is a 'cheating pass'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UK news organization, Telegraph, &lt;a href="https://twitchy.com/sarahd-313035/2019/11/06/paging-all-married-men-uk-telegraph-thinks-you-should-consider-giving-your-wife-permission-to-cheat-on-you-for-christmas/"&gt;recently tweeted a link&lt;/a&gt; to their article 'Why Men Should Give Their Wives a Cheating Pass This Christmas'. In the year old article,&amp;nbsp; feminist researcher&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https:/twitter.com/wednesdaymartin?lang=en" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wednesday Martin, PhD &lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;" If we have a pleasure revolution and start to put female sexual pleasure at the center of our sexual universe, there's a case to be made that could change relationships outside the bedroom as well."&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;Telegraph's article stated:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;"MeToo has given women a louder voice in the arena of sexual politics. And since female sexual autonomy is , argues Martin, a feminist issue closely interlinked with the power and autonomy women have in the workforce and in politics, the significance of the online movement should not be overlooked".&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin claims that women struggle more than men with the same familiar partner day after day.&lt;br /&gt;She said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"We now know long-term relationships are harder on female desire than they are on male desire.&amp;nbsp; Many experts now believe monogamy is a tighter fit for women than for men.&lt;br /&gt;Why is it better to get a divorce and move on when you simply decide 'I don't fancy him any more', or the spark is gone... What a trail of destruction you might save yourself from creating if you said instead: is there something we can do here? This Christmas give your wife something she really wants. Something truly exciting. A hall pass&lt;/i&gt; [for cheating]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;Neither Martin nor the Telegraph reference any objective study conclusively proving long term relationships are harder on women's sexuality than men's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, Martin is advocating that cheating wives should not divorce their husbands because that would mean the wife would now have to go thru the difficulty of finding a new man willing to have a committed relationship.&amp;nbsp; Instead, Martin advises cheating wives to keep their current husband and continue abusing him. Lastly, she recommends husbands give their wives a 'cheating pass' as a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine the outrage if anti feminists or men's rights activists advocated that wives should give their husbands a 'cheating pass' for Christmas. Imagine feminist reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsurprisingly, Martin stated she would not give her husband a cheating pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Telegraph article and Wednesday Martin are prime evidence that feminism is an ideology promoting sexism and exploitation.</content>

    <title type="text">Katie Hill Demands Female Privilege</title>
    <content type="html">California Representative Katie Hill&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/31/katie-hill-farewell-speech-resignation-063075" rel="nofollow"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; her post after it has been discovered she had a relationship with a woman on her congressional campaign staff. She gave a scathing resignation speech, in which she claimed she is the victim of a gendered "double standard" in society that has punished her for her sexual life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;I am leaving now because of a double standard. I am leaving because I no longer want to be used as a bargaining chip&lt;/i&gt;, she said on the House floor, “&lt;i&gt;I’m leaving because of a misogynistic culture that gleefully consumed my naked pictures.&lt;/i&gt;” She claimed male politicians are not held to the same standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms Hill's resignation was announce three days after the website Redstate published text messages and photos, showing her in a relationship with a campaign staffer, which she previously denied.&amp;nbsp; The UK's Daily Mail has also published nude photos of Ms HIll from that relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, Redstate also published allegations that Ms Hill engaged in a sexual relationship with a male subordinate. She has thus far continued to deny that accussation.&amp;nbsp; Before her resignation, a House Ethics Committee was planning an investigation of Ms Hill for possible ehtics violations concerning her realtionships with her staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her farewell speech, she said those photos were "&lt;i&gt;the forces of revenge by a bitter jealous man&lt;/i&gt;", in an apparent reference to her estranged husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last statement seems to indicate Hill is lying yet again. If she wasn't cheating on her husband with a male subordinate&amp;nbsp; then what would her husband be jealous about?&amp;nbsp; Katie Hill has since hired revenge porn attorney Carrie Goldberg and plans on suing all those involved in publishing her "porn" pictures.. However, Redstate and Daily Mail are not porn sites. They are news sites. Therefore the pictures were not porn. They were evidence that Hill - a politician - was lying about her relationships and possible ethics code violations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie Hill claims she is&amp;nbsp; a victim of gender double standard but in fact she is advocating a feminist double standard. She is demanding that she not be held to the same standards as male politicians. Here are just a few male politicians who were forced out of their posts in similar situations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;Joe Barton (Texas) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;He was separated from his wife prior to their divorce. During this time, he had&amp;nbsp; consensual&amp;nbsp; relationships with several women.&amp;nbsp; Somehow a nude photo of him from one of the relationships was posted on social media without his consent. He was forced not to run for re -election in 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Al Franken (Minnesota)&lt;br /&gt;He was accused of unwanted touching by several women. During his resignation speech he said ,&lt;i&gt;"I also think it gave some people the false impression that I was admitting to doing things that, in fact, I haven’t done." "Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others, I remember very differently.&lt;/i&gt;"&amp;nbsp; Accusations were the only evidence against him. Nonetheless, he was forced to resign in 2018.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Murphy (Pennsylvania)&lt;br /&gt;He admitted to an extramarital affair with a “personal friend” and encouraged his lover to terminate an unplanned pregnancy. He was forced to resign in 2017.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wesley Goodman (Ohio)&lt;br /&gt;He admitted having an inappropriate&amp;nbsp; extramarital relationship with a male member of his staff.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Additionally, the Washington Post also accused him of an unwanted sexual advance with an 18 year old male. That allegation was not proven. As a result of his extramarital relationship, Goodman was forced to resign in 2017.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff Clemens (Florida)&lt;br /&gt;He admitted to having an affair with a lobbyist. He was forced to resign in 2017.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Bill Dix (Iowa)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;After a video surfaced showing him kissing with a lobbyist, he was forced to resign in 2017.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mark Souder (Indiana)&lt;br /&gt;He was forced to resign in 2010 after he admitted to having an affair with one of his congressional staffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Katie Hill is a sexist. The only double standard is her own and it is based on feminism (ie female privilege).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Additionally, as a sign of the changing times, many in the public are no longer buying into feminist hypocricy. Below are the top 10 comments from a Yahoonews article titled&lt;br /&gt;"Katie Hill delivers scathing resignation speech after Trump impeachment vote:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/katie-hill-delivers-scathing-resignation-191829025.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;'I am leaving because of a double standard'&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2F1RHd9IkOE/XcCU2DVI8QI/AAAAAAAAAFg/n0NXiu7B9nUZrG84O-e5VEAtxyUfmtB6gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/2019nov.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="1405" data-original-width="857" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2F1RHd9IkOE/XcCU2DVI8QI/AAAAAAAAAFg/n0NXiu7B9nUZrG84O-e5VEAtxyUfmtB6gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/2019nov.jpg" width="195" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ms. Hill has become the new face for feminist double standards.</content>

    <title type="text">Naive Men</title>
    <content type="html">There are some men who are still naive. They live in a "Walt Disney' world where they believe&amp;nbsp; all women are good therefore any women will make a caring and loving wife. Simply pick one and get married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One such man was Drew Bates, a law enforcement officer in Madison County, Alabama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He married Lyndsey Sherrod, high school teacher, in May 2018 thinking life would be like a Walt Disney movie.&amp;nbsp; In less than one year she was lying to him and &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6921073/Alabama-teacher-married-sheriff-deputys-son-arrested-having-sex-student.html"&gt;cheating on him&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; with a high school student who was either 16 or 17.&amp;nbsp; Lyndsey&amp;nbsp; has recently been arrested for having sex with a minor.&amp;nbsp; She is also charged with several misdemeanors including three counts of distributing obscene material to a student and one count of having sexual contact with a student, as per Madison County jail records. She is also charged with engaging in a sex act with a student younger than 19.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'&lt;i&gt;Because the victim(s) in these charges are juveniles no specific details of the investigation are being released at this time,&lt;/i&gt;' office spokesman Donny Shaw said in a statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Reuters report said that in 2014 almost 800 school employees were prosecuted for sexual assault in U.S. schools and nearly &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-teachers/u-s-cracks-down-on-female-teachers-who-sexually-abuse-students-idUSKBN0NC14H20150421"&gt;a third of them were women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days after Lyndsey's arrest, Andrew Bates filed for divorce, citing “incompatibility” in court filings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a man reading this story and you want to get married - at least take the time to vet women so that you dont end up with a backstabbing, garbage wife.&amp;nbsp; Life is not a Walt Disney movie. All women are not good.</content>

    <title type="text">NASA Continues Wasting Billions on Mindless Agenda</title>
    <content type="html">NASA recently spen an undisclosed amount of money so that two women could walk in space at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/fridays-all-woman-spacewalk-the-basics"&gt;NASA stated:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Although it's the 221st spacewalk performed in support of space station assembly, it's the first to be conducted entirely by women"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The first all-woman spacewalk is a milestone worth noting and celebrating as the agency looks forward to putting the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024 with NASA’s Artemis lunar exploration program. "&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"When asked in an interview about the importance of conducting her mission and this spacewalk, Koch said, “In the end, I do think it’s important, and I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing. In the past women haven’t always been at the table. It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role. That can lead in turn to increased chance for success. There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories of people who look like them, and I think it’s an important story to tell."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;NASA then claimed that the all female walk was unplanned. If it was unplanned then why the pre-walk hype?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the advancement of science?&amp;nbsp; The all female space walk is insignificant for human advancement into space. It contributes nothing to scientific knowledge. NASA has been spending billions over the last several decades on mindless unscientific goals. Wasting money on goals such as this is exactly why NASA has been unable to produce a manned interplanetary ship despite the fact the moon landings happened half a century ago. On average, a manned space flight to Mars still takes between 6-9 months. Thats a long time. NASA as been unable to improve upon this time for the past several decades. The agency has been stagnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe its time to replace NASA's current managers with people who are actually interested in scientific progress rather than pursuing mindless, unscientific, feminist agenda.</content>

    <title type="text">Women Break New Barriers in Space</title>
    <content type="html">Women have broken thru a barrier in space.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/nasa-astronaut-anne-mcclain.html"&gt;Astronaut Anne McClain is being accused of identity theft&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by her former wife Summer Worden. This is the first time in history a criminal accusation has been made against any human being working in space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worden claims McClain illegally accessed her bank account from the International Space Station during her mission between December 2018 and June 2019. Worden claims McClain had no right to access her account.&amp;nbsp; The couple is currently involved in a contentious divorce. The accused has denied any improper conduct on social media. She argues that while she did check the account, it was to monitor family finances. McClain claims her ex wife has "&lt;i&gt;an explosive temper and was making poor financial decisions&lt;/i&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although never tested, supposedly there is an agreement between each country involved in the International Space Station. The agreement states that each country will have jurisdiction over their own nationals as long as any alleged crime does not involve a national from another country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incident is especially ironic considering a recent NBCNews article claimed &lt;a href="https://antifeministsite.blogspot.com/2019/09/nbcnews-displays-its-sexist-culture.html"&gt;"heterosexuality is just not working."&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title type="text">NBCNews Displays Its Sexist Culture With Anti Male Article</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="tr_bq"&gt;NBCNews recently posted an article claiming&amp;nbsp; men need heterosexuality to maintain their societal dominance over women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190826014142/https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/miley-cyrus-split-liam-hemsworth-isn-t-just-celebrity-fodder-ncna1042931" rel="nofollow"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;states:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Over the past week, an assortment of trending stories - from Jeffrey Epstein to the Dayton and El Paso mass shooters, to Miley Cyrus's separation and Julianne Hough's declaration that she's 'not straight' - together have laid bare the strictures of an American patriarchy on the edge of a nervous breakdown. As the status quo, heterosexuality is just not working."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Men continue to coerce, harass, rape and kill girls and women - and go to extreme lengths to avoid responsibility for their actions.&amp;nbsp; Framed differently, the picture is this: Men need heterosexuality to maintain their societal dominance over women. Women, on the other hand, are increasingly realizing not only that they don't need heterosexuality, but that it also is often the bedrock of their global oppression.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;"this notion - that an adult is responsible for their own sex life (how they have sex, who they have sex with, when, where, and why they have sex) -portrays a sharp contrast in our culture. Where men seem to never to have to take responsibility for their actions, women always must take responsibility for not only their own actions but the actions of men."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Absconding from responsibility is the quintessential strategy of the patriarchy; its how men stay in control and never lose their power."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The NBCNews article stereotypes men as violent and rapists. It stereotypes women as honest people who are continuously victims of male crimes. These are archaic feminist gender stereotypes. The vast majority of men are not rapping nor killing women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, NBC's statement that men arent held accountable for their actions while women&amp;nbsp; "must take responsibility for not only their own actions but the actions of men." is a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Two words come to mind -&amp;nbsp; paternity fraud.&amp;nbsp; In most states of the US, paternity fraud is still legal. A cheating wife suffers no repercussions from tricking her husband into raising and financing her boyfriend's child. She can legally exploit him for her own benefit. SHE IS NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR HER ACTIONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/courts-lenient-sentencing-bond-women/"&gt;women are rarely given jail sentences&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;equal to that of male criminals DESPITE committing the exact same crime. The American legal system does not hold women accountable for their actions to the same degree as men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some sexist researchers still &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190908010935/https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/relationships/the-reasons-why-married-women-cheat-on-their-husbands/ar-AAD15NO?q=3" rel="nofollow"&gt;blame men for their wives cheating.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Alicia M. Walker, a researcher at Missouri State University states &lt;i&gt;"Any man who is concerned about this,[her cheating] you should really start looking at your own behavior in the bedroom and really make sure that you're holding up your end of the table. Because, if you're not, there's somebody out there who's more than willing to do that."&lt;/i&gt; In other words, Walker does not hold women accountable for their actions.&amp;nbsp; Men&amp;nbsp; must take responsibility for not only their own actions but also the actions of women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the question must be asked: How many false rape accusers have gone to jail? The answer is:&amp;nbsp; Hardly any. False rape accusers - the vast majority of whom are women - are rarely held accountable for their actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NBCNews article is laced with lies and outright gender hate. It is representative of the sexist mentality within the news organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title type="text">Two Feminist Senators Demand Investigation Into Pay Disparity between WNBA and NBA</title>
    <content type="html">U.S. Feminist Senators Jacky Rosen and Amy Klobuchar sent a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation demanding he hold a hearing about pay disparity between men's and women's sports in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the letter, the Senators state:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-klobuchar-press-hearing-pay-disparity-between-men-and-women-athletes" rel="nofollow"&gt;"The gender pay gap is not limited to soccer—it spans many sports in the United States. In 2017, the U.S. Women’s Hockey Team threatened to boycott the 2018 Winter Olympics over inadequate pay and support. The players were reportedly provided $1,000 per month during the six-month Olympic residency period and very little else throughout the four years between Olympic Games. Last year in the Women's National Basketball Association, the maximum veteran player salary was $115,500, while the men in the National Basketball Association earned a minimum salary of $582,180. Despite four Grand Slam tennis tournaments in which men and women players are compensated equally, women tennis players are only earning 80 cents on each dollar that men earn in other matches. Although the Ladies Professional Golf Association this year will distribute a record of roughly $70 million in prize money, this is only close to one-fifth what the men will receive from the Professional Golf Association Tour. "&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The feminists politicians completely ignored the fact that neither the US women's World Cup nor USA hockey creates equal revenue with their male counter parts. The idea that WNBA players should be paid the same as their male counterparts is completely asinine. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2018/02/07/forbes-releases-20th-annual-nba-team-valuations/#3c9c4af134e6the"&gt;According to a Forbes,&lt;/a&gt; NBA's 30 teams made $7.4 billion in 2017. According to Adam Grosbard of the &lt;a href="https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/other-sports/wnba/2018/06/26/staggering-root-wnba-players-argument-gender-wage-gap-basketball"&gt;Dallas Morning News,&lt;/a&gt;, the league's 12 teams made at about $51.5 million in 2017.&amp;nbsp; No recent figures are available for golf. However, in 2013, the last year in which both golf organization's tax documents are available, the PGA Tour Inc. brought in $1.075 billion while the LPGA earned $102.8 million in total revenue,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The feminist politicians deemed generated revenue as irrelevant. They believed that female athletes should not have to create the same revenue as men in order to be paid the same wages as men.&amp;nbsp; What Rosen and Klobuchar are advocating is that female athletes be paid simply for being women. Thats outright sexism. It is female privilege.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Every time feminists gain power, they seek female privilege.&amp;nbsp; Jacky Rosen and Amy Klobuchar help create and modify both Federal and state laws&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They are examples of why voting is so important. Senators&amp;nbsp; Rosen and Klobuchar contention that wages should be based on gender rather than generated revenue is pure sexism.</content>

    <title type="text">USA Soccer's Alex Morgan Asks For Female Privilege</title>
    <content type="html">United States women's national soccer team player Alex Morgan was criticized for mocking Britain when she sipped tea after scoring a goal during the Women's World Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan responded by stating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190705221920/https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2019/07/05/world-cup-2019-alex-morgan-points-out-sexism-uswnt-celebrations/1657732001/" rel="nofollow"&gt;"&lt;i&gt;There is some sort of double standard for females in sports to feel like we have to be humble in our successes and have to celebrate but not too much and have to do something, but it always needs to be a limited fashion," she said. "You see men celebrate all over the world in big tournaments, you know, grabbing their sacks or whatever it is&lt;/i&gt;."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"When I look at sipping a cup of tea, I'm a little taken aback and kind of laugh about it to see all the criticism,"&lt;/i&gt; she continued. &lt;i&gt;"So I"m a little disappointed about that.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;When male players act unsportsmanlike they are often criticized. Alex Morgan is asking for special privileges simply because she is a women.&amp;nbsp; The double standard is all hers. Morgan's actions were arrogant. She mocked the British culture. This is exactly why much of the world hates this team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article also displays an entrenched sexist culture within USAToday. The news organization was outraged that anyone would criticize a female athlete. Yet USAToday has no problem criticizing male athletes. They often criticize NFL player Odell Beckham . In this &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190610175250/https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/06/odell-beckham-drains-public-sympathy-complaints" rel="nofollow"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, USAToday list a host of criticisms against him. They also criticize many other male athletes for an array of reasons in the NFL, NHL MLB and NBA. However, the sexists journalists of USAToday are angered that the same standards of conduct are now being applied to female athletes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to&amp;nbsp; Morgan, USAToday is demanding female privilege.</content>

    <title type="text">Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar</title>
    <content type="html">Presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar was recently asked about the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings. Kavanaugh had been accused of sexual assault by Blasey Ford during the hearings. Ford claimed the assault happened over 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalist Bret Baier asked Klobuchar:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190509012909/https://www.vox.com/2019/5/8/18537600/amy-klobuchar-fox-news-al-franken-brett-kavanaugh" rel="nofollow"&gt;"What about Brett Kavanaugh? Did he have due process when he was questioned by you in that committee? And did he have due process being innocent before proven guilty by Democrats in that process?"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;She responded by saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/05/08/amy-klobuchar-due-process-brett-kavanaugh/"&gt;"I'm only smiling because, like, he got a really good job out of the whole thing. Okay, he's like on the Supreme Court of the United States. Yes, I think he did. We had a process, and that process was a hearing before the Senate. And that hearing went on and then new evidence came out and that was evidence from Dr. Blasey Ford, who even my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who supported Judge Kavanaugh and voted for him, said that she was credible. She came forward with her story."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What colleague said she was credible? Klobuchar refused to mention any name. She refused to even state how Ford's 30 year old story of alleged assault is even credible. No evidence was ever presented that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. Ford simply claimed he was a rapist. Klobuchar made it clear that if she were in charge of voting, Kavanaugh would be denied a job and charged with sexual assault. Amy Klobuchar&amp;nbsp; wanted to run the hearing identical to college campus sexual assault investigations - where guilt is determined on the basis of the accused and accuser's gender.&amp;nbsp; The senator is a female chauvinist - in other words she is a feminist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Klobuchar is an official who represents an entire state.&amp;nbsp; She is an example of why you should never vote for a feminist.</content>

    <title type="text">Captain Marvel Offers More Evidence Feminism is Sexism</title>
    <content type="html">Captain Marvel is a fantasy movie whose main character is a female superhero played by feminist actress Brie Larson.&amp;nbsp; Feminists are using this movie to promote sexism and express hatred toward men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feminist Constance Grady wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190314160259/https://www.vox.com/2019/3/12/18256544/captain-marvel-sexism-box-office-success" rel="nofollow"&gt;" [The film] has to be good enough to make up for decades of movies that relentlessly focused on the narratives of straight white men. It has to give women a superhero in whom they can see themselves and their lives (one character! To reflect the experiences of every single woman!). And in turn, viewers - especially women - have to see themselves in Captain Marvel. If they don't, maybe its because of their male privilege (men) or their internalized misogyny (everyone else). Good feminist viewers have to do their part to lift this movie up, because don't you want women to get representation?"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Grady does not want this film to be a simple fantasy story for entertainment. Instead, she wants a Nazi like propaganda film emphasizing women.&amp;nbsp; Also, Grady can barely conceal her contempt for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to show how out of touch with reality she is, Ms Grady also stated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Captain Marvel has to make enough money to prove that movies starring women can do well”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Grady acts as if there has never been a movie starring a women. Maybe she never heard of "Wizard Of OZ", a popular movie starring a women THAT WAS MADE OVER 70 YEARS AGO!&amp;nbsp; Or how about 'Alien' - A MOVIE FROM 1979! What the feminist is tacitly saying is she does not want to see any movies with lead male characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feminist Alyssa Klein tweeted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.fo/5S6df" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I'm so excited to finally see Marvel's first woman superhero movie. I'm less excited about the fact that many of the biggest publications are having men write their #CaptainMarvel reviews. Want proof? Here's a thread of Captain Marvel reviews written by men."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.fo/uH8IX" rel="nofollow"&gt;"To be clear: I believe the majority of #CaptainMarvel reviews at major publications should be written by women (but not *only* women). I enjoyed our conversation and I'm excited to continue this important discussion!"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Klein is advocating a sexist system where work is obtained on the basis of gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feminist website &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190310054826/https://www.themarysue.com/about/" rel="nofollow"&gt; 'Mary Sue' &lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; tweeted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.fo/hoLrV" rel="nofollow"&gt;"All the negative reviews for #CaptainMarvel are from men"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The website believes there should be no criticism of this movie because it featured a female main character.&amp;nbsp; Additionally,, the feminist website is trying to invalidate any male viewpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the film features feminist actress Brie Larson. She has previously stated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I don't need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn't work about A Wrinkle in Time. It wasn't made for him! I want to know what it meant to women of color, biracial women, to teen women of color, to teens that are biracial."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x0T6oedzTLY/XI7BwXHNO9I/AAAAAAAAAEY/iemleBk5Prkrek62088sPdYK8B4k9wOAwCLcBGAs/s1600/2019MarchWatson.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="671" data-original-width="733" height="292" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x0T6oedzTLY/XI7BwXHNO9I/AAAAAAAAAEY/iemleBk5Prkrek62088sPdYK8B4k9wOAwCLcBGAs/s320/2019MarchWatson.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190205212725/https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/brie-larson-empowering-film-captain-marvel-superpower/story?id=60856648" rel="nofollow"&gt;"the movie was the biggest and best opportunity I could have ever asked for. It was, like, my superpower. This could be my form of activism: doing a film that can play all over the world and be in more places than I can be physically." &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;Larson is a messenger of hate. She judges people on the basis of their gender and skin color. Additionally, she wants to use this movie as a propaganda platform to project her sexism and prejudice 'all over the world'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The statements from feminists concerning Captain Marvel provide more evidence feminism is an ideology based on sexism and hate.</content>
